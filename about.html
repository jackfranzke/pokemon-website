                    <p>I started collecting Pokemon cards a few years back when
                         my grandma would do some shopping for Target and every time
                         we went there, I would always ask for a small Pokemon pack 
                         and she would say yes. This kept repeating for one year and
                          my parents decided to get me a metal box full of Pokemon 
                          cards and I was excited about it. I only collect in small 
                          packs now and I don't like to battle with them because I
                           don't know how to battle.
                        </p>
                    <p>There are only a few things that I actually especially 
                        like and they are: games, puzzles, and connect the dots. 
                        I like games because they're a great way to deal with 
                        stress. What do I mean by that? Well, by absolutely 
                        demolishing every single enemy in your sight. Then, I 
                        like puzzles because I think they're fun and gives me a 
                        challenge and I like to complete challenges. Lastly, I 
                        enjoy connect the dots because you are slowly creating 
                        something by connecting dots like for example, you might 
                        connect dots into the shape of a dog or a cat.</p>

                    <p>I am Jack Franzke and I have a second degree black belt and there are nine degrees of black belt in Taekwondo. 
                       Obtaining each degree gets harder and harder like for example, I had to be a first degree black belt for a year before I could get the chance to obtain my second degree. 
                       The test was really difficult, but I passed and obtained my second degree. I have been praticing Taekwondo for six years of my life and have gotten to know the people that go to the dojo. 
                       This picture is the final part of my test where I had to execute a flying sidekick to break the board in the picture.</p>
